# Individual Project: CRUD-application with localStorage

Unfortunately I hade to use an API key for this project, meaning I could not publish it on github pages, and viewing the project locally requires you to setup your own API key (a key can be acquired here: https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/free-to-play-games-database). Below I've instead got some screenshots of what the page looks like, as well as a gif that shows how the site works. Although the gif is quite small so it's a bit hard to see.

**Features**
- List of all games on the landing page.
- Filter games by tags.
- Add/remove bookmarks by clicking the bookmark icon.
- Click a game to be redirected to a page with more detailed game information.
- Add/update your rating for a game by clicking the stars on game details page.
